# ROS Point Cloud Construction

This script streamlines the creation of a point cloud along the entire trajectory of a moving robot. It employs transformation matrices to seamlessly convert lidar data from the lidar coordinate system to the "map" coordinate system. The implementation makes use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the TF library for effective management of coordinate frame transformations.

## Key Features

**ROS Integration:**
   - Utilizes ROS functionalities to efficiently handle bag files.
   - Extracts point cloud data from the specified topic ("/points").

**TF Library Usage:**
   - Leverages the TF library for smooth management of transformations between coordinate frames.
   - Applies transformation matrices to align lidar data with the "map" coordinate system, ensuring a comprehensive point cloud representation.

**Robustness:**
   - Implements robust error-handling mechanisms, including handling ExtrapolationExceptions during TF lookups.
   - Addresses potential exceptions that may arise when reading ROS bag files.

**Optimization:**
   - Incorporates optimizations, such as processing every 20th message from the "/points" topic to enhance the efficiency of point cloud construction.
